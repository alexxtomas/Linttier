## WHAT IS LINNTIER? ✨

Linttier allows you to install a standard based prettier and eslint configuration in your React or Node projects, either with JavaScript or TypesScript.
New features will be added soon...

## TO CONSIDER ❗

In any of the options you need to have a package.json file in the same path where you run linttier so that linttier automatically installs the dependencies.
In the typescript options, you also need to have a tsconfig.json and important that it does not contain comments

```json
npm install -g linttier
